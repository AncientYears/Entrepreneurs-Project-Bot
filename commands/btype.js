That is an invalid business type.

[ Farm ] 
# You are able to produce raw goods, e.g fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy products, etc.
[ Advantages ]
# No need to constantly buy stocks from other companies
# Companies rely on your materials, meaning you can set the prices
[ Disadvantages ]
# Your profits depend on quality of crops, season, weather etc.
# You have limited access to other companies so trade might be a bit difficult\`\`\`
