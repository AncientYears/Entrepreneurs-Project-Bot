That is an invalid business type.

The types are as follows:\`\`\`css
[ ★ Farm ★ ] 
# You are able to produce raw goods, e.g fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy products, etc.
[ Advantages ]
# No need to constantly buy stocks from other companies
# Companies rely on your materials, meaning you can set the prices
[ Disadvantages ]
# Your profits depend on quality of crops, season, weather etc.
# You have limited access to other companies so trade might be a bit difficult\`\`\`   
\`\`\`css
[ Factory ]
# You are able to buy raw goods from farms and process them to create something new
[ Advantages ]
# You can sell the new items you produce for more profit
# No limit to what items you can produce
[ Disadvantages ]
# You depend on farms and other raw material producers for profit
# You can lose money when demand drops for your product\`\`\`
\`\`\`css
[ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED DO NOT USE ! ]
[ Shop ]
# You buy stock for cheap and sell it for more to make a profit.
[ Advantages ]
# You can buy stock from both raw-material producers and factories
# You can advertise your shop to get more people to buy your stock
[ Disadvantages ]
# You may have to lower the price for customers to buy a certain item
# You are limited in wether/season conditions due to the fact that you need to buy stock from other companies.\`\`\`
